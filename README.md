# CK3-InspirationFilters #

This mod has been fixed by me for
**v1.18!**

It overwrites **'gui/window_inspirations.gui'** so may not be compatible with other mods that also modify that file.

This is my first attempt at CK3 modding, Improvements and contributions are welcome!


## ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION: ##

This mod adds a small menu which lets you filter inspiration notifications by their craft level (Legendary, Master, Competent, Normal)

### UPDATE ###
Now the filters apply to inspirations list in the court screen too
